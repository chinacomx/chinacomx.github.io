As part of the cooperation between [Nanjing University of the Arts](https://www.nua.edu.cn/main.htm) (NUA) and CATS Library in Heidelberg, ChinaComx PI Lena Henningsen is [giving a talk](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zpwwJBrS_XEkgQ0f67uJxw) at NUA about her research on adaptations of lianhuanhua on 9th October, 2025, at 14:30. The talk will be held at the Lecture Hall (报告厅) of the [Art Museum of NUA](http://www.nuamuseum.org/nuamuseum/index.html) (AMNUA).

In the talk titled "Reframing LuXun and his literature in Lianhuanhua", she will argue that adaptation and transmedial processes are constitutive for Chinese lianhuanhua. Using the example of adaptations of the life and work of Lu Xun, she will point to the variety in style, expression and messages conveyed. She will demonstrate that lianhuanhua that are adapted from literary texts may seem to have flattened or oversimplified the original text; however, very often, the visuals add new ambivalence into the story, thus updating the original work into the present context. Acknowledging the importance of adaptation for the lianhuanhua genre thus not only points to a core characteristic of this form of art, but also to the wider processes of adaptation in (popular) cultural production in China.

The talk is also part of the 2025 German-Chinese Media Summer Academy for Youth at the [School of Media Arts and Communication, NUA](https://media.nua.edu.cn/). For previous seasons of the summer academy at NUA, see [here](https://media.nua.edu.cn/2023/0904/c4854a101682/page.htm).
