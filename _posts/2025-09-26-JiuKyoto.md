On September 26-28, 2025, ChinaComx Phd Candidate [Jiu Song](https://chinacomx.github.io/team/jiu/) will attend the 18th Next-Generation Global Workshop at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en), Japan. The workshop is organized by the [Kyoto University Asian Studies Unit (KUASU)](https://www.kuasu.cpier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/english/) under the theme “Visual Media in a Post-Growth Era.”

While her earlier presentations on younger generations focused mainly on questions of memory and intergenerational transmission, this time her research places greater emphasis on the ways in which visual media themselves shape and articulate identity. By addressing how visual forms and digital platforms mediate the reappropriation of lianhuanhua, her talk also speaks to broader issues of cultural expression and social transformation in the post-growth era. Jiu Song will present in Session 2: Social Consciousness in Representation on September 27. Her talk is entitled “Prosthetic Nostalgia and Identity in Chinese Comics: Generation Z’s Fan Reappropriation of Lianhuanhua.”
