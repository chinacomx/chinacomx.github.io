ChinaComx PhD Candidate [Astrid Y. Xiao](https://chinacomx.github.io/team/astrid/) will present her research during the 2025 [Postcolonial Narrations Conference](https://postcolonial-narrations.net/current_conference/). The conference will be held on 23-24 September 2025 at [St Hilda’s College, the University of Oxford](https://www.st-hildas.ox.ac.uk/), under the theme "Inner Circles: Kinship, Inclusion, and Inaccessibility".

Astrid will present her work on the second day as part of Panel 5: Extending the Family Circle. Her presentation is titled “Forsaking the ‘Small Family’ for the ‘Big Family’ (舍"小家"为"大家"): Kinship Narrative, Collectivist Education, and Intergenerational Transmission in Mao-Era Lianhuanhua.” In her paper, she focuses on how the state reframed the relationship between the xiao jia (“small family”, the individual and their family) and the da jia (“big family”, the collective or the nation), guiding individuals away from enclosed domestic spheres and into a carefully constructed moral and political inner circle of socialist belonging.
