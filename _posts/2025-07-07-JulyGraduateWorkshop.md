**In Search of Brazilian Culture through Post-Mao China: Notes on an Illustrated Report by the Brazilian Cartoonist Henfil (1977-1980)**
> In 1977, Brazilian cartoonist Henfil undertook a two-week visit to China, an experience he documented in a series of newspaper articles that were subsequently compiled into a book. _Henfil na China (antes da Coca-Cola)_ constitutes not only a rare moment of an active engagement between the Brazilian and Chinese comics traditions but is also part of a broader historical context marked by Latin American intellectual and artistic engagements with China. Additionally, the work reflects the transnational ambitions of a number of Brazilian cartoonists who, during the military dictatorship (1964–1985), sought to establish international networks as a means of cultural and political resistance. This presentation offers a preliminary investigation into these themes, drawing on concepts such as transnationalism in comics and world literature to situate Henfil’s production within the Brazilian comics culture of the 1970s - a field shaped by efforts to navigate a print market constrained by censorship and authoritarian control. I argue that Henfil na China embodies a condition of transit by challenging conventional categorizations, as it brings together cartoons, illustrations, photographs, and travel writing within a single hybrid format.

The workshop is co-organized by ChinaComx PI, [Lena Henningsen](https://chinacomx.github.io/team/lena/), and [Anna Kollatz](https://www.ori.uni-heidelberg.de/islamwissenschaft/institut/mitarbeiter/kollatz.html#forschungsgebiet), the co-PI of the research project ["Wo ist der Witz? Karikaturen als Kommunikationssphäre im spät- und postosmanischen Kontext"](https://caricatures.hypotheses.org/499).
