ChinaComx PhD candidate [Aijia Zhang](https://chinacomx.github.io/team/aijia/) is to take part in the [Hong Kong Association for Digital Humanities 2026 Conference](https://2026.hkadh.org/) this January. Hosted by [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/) on 23-25 January 2026, the event explores digital humanities in the era of AI.

In her panel “__Image Synthesis, Immersion & Multimodality__” (16:30–18:30) on __23 January__, Aijia will share her current research titled “__Lianhuanhua in the Age of AI: Multimodality, Distant Perceiving, and the Ethics__”. She examines the potential _lianhuanhua_ offered to the digital humanities with its multimodal nature, and discusses her practices of using AI in digital humanities research. Reflecting on her previous projects on the texts and images of over 300 _lianhuanhua_, her talk explores how AI increases the efficiency in data normalization and preparation while raising potential problems. Using concrete examples, she shares her attempts at applying AI in research while keeping track of the obscurity in models and algorithms.
