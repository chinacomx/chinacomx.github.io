    <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 5px; text-align: justify;"> 
        <p>We are happy to share our comprehensive reference list of selected scholarly publications on lianhuanhua‚ÄîChinese comics‚Äîcompiled by the ChinaComx project (most recent update: 10 April 2025). This list is to serve as both an entry point for students of Chinese visual culture and a curated snapshot of current scholarship. It is not a peer-reviewed bibliography, nor should exclusion from this list be taken as a negative judgment; it is simply a selection of texts we find particularly interesting at this moment and hope will be useful to other researchers. We hope you might approach this list as an invitation: it invites you to read and engage with the vast academic literature on all things lianhuanhua; it invites you to share with us other publications that we might have overlooked; and it invites all of us to explore the fascinating world(s) of Chinese comics. ‚û°Ô∏è <a href="/assets/images/ChinaComxLianhuanhuaBibliography-v260925.pdf" download>Get the PDF here!</a></p>
