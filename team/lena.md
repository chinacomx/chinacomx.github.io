Within the ChinaComx project, I currently work on a monograph on adaptations of the works and biography of Lu Xun into lianhuanhua. I am fascinated how these works inscribed Lu Xun into the revolutionary pantheon and into the literary canon of socialist China – while at the same time preserving the ambivalence so deeply ingrained in the works and life of Lu Xun. I also enjoy organizing workshops, translating lianhuanhua, preparing other people’s translations for our webpage and publishing widely on Chinese literature and culture.

Before returning to Heidelberg (where I did my PhD and a PostDoc), I was a Junior Professor at Freiburg University and headed another ERC project, devoted to the [practices of reading in the People’s Republic of China](https://readchina.github.io), interspersed by research stays at TU Munich and Oxford University.
