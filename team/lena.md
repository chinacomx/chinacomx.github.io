description:  Adaptations in and of lianhuanhua.
---

Lena Henningsen is the PI of the ChinaComx project. As part of the project, she works on a monograph on adaptations of the works and biography of Lu Xun into lianhuanhua. She is fascinated how these works inscribed Lu Xun into the revolutionary pantheon and into the literary canon of socialist China – while at the same time preserving the ambivalence so deeply ingrained in the works and life of Lu Xun.

Lena previously headed another ERC project, devoted to the practices of reading in the People’s Republic of China (https://readchina.github.io) and published widely on Chinese literature and culture.
