description: Aesthetics and theories of lianhuanhua.
---

I work on modern Chinese literature and culture, with a main focus on popular culture and visual texts such as comics and picturebooks. My doctoral thesis investigates the aesthetic features and political functions of a Chinese comics genre, lianhuanhua, which was extensively published during the 20th century and enjoyed a wide-ranging readership across different age groups. Based on the political environment and literary production in Maoist China (1949-1976), my project examines how lianhuanhua were designed to reshape youth, construct their political and national identities, and mold them into New Socialist Individuals. My research methods include archival research, image-text analysis, and adaptation theories.
 
I am also interested in children’s literature, game studies, and fan studies.
