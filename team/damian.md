At ChinaComx, I research the politics behind and within lianhuanhua. I approach these palm-sized booklets as a distinctively affective medium that bridged state propaganda and popular entertainment. Specifically, my sub-project explores such themes as: the relationship between political campaigns and lianhuanhua; occurrences of Maoism (as both ideology and state bureaucracy) within storylines; various depictions of political and national enemies; uses of lianhuanhua as manuals for new socialist knowledge and norms of behavior; as well as questions related to the role of lianhuanhua in the project of socialist modernisation. 

Beyond my historical research, I serve as the project’s coordinator for graphic and web design, overseeing the visual identity and digital curatorship efforts of our output, and aid the ongoing expansion of the [CATS-Seifert Collection of Chinese Comics](https://www.cats.uni-heidelberg.de/library/collections/chinese.html). 

Prior to joining Heidelberg University, I contributed to the research projects [“The Politics of Reading in the PRC“](https://readchina.github.io/) and ["The Maoist Legacy: Party Dictatorship, Transitional Justice and the Politics of Truth"](https://www.maoistlegacy.de/) at the University of Freiburg. I am also an editor and collaborator in the ongoing international project [“Revisiting the Revolution: Engaging Chinese Scholarship through Collaborative Translation”](https://networks.h-net.org/group/pages/20033515/revisiting-revolution). My first monograph, currently in preparation, tackles the phenomenon of political study and other collective reading practices in the PRC.
