description: Lianhuanhua in and out of the hands of politics.
---

I am working on the intersections of politics, daily life, propaganda, and visual culture in China after 1949. At ChinaComx, I am researching the politics of lianhuanhua both in their national and also international entanglements. I do so by approaching lianhuanhua as comics, that is, a hot and affective medium that found use in political communication efforts and enjoyed a mass readership alike. I am also responsible for the graphic and web design of  ChinaComx. My first book project tackles the phenomenon of political study and other collective reading practices in the PRC after 1949. Previous to joining Heidelberg University, I worked in two ERC-projects at the University of Freiburg: in 2018-2019 at “The Maoist Legacy” (https://www.maoistlegacy.de/) and in 2019-2023 at “READCHINA” (https://readchina.github.io). I am also a collaborator in the project “Revisiting the Revolution: Engaging Chinese Scholarship through Collaborative Translation” (http://prchistory.org/revisiting-the-revolution-landing-page/).
