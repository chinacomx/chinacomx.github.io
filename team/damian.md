I am working on the intersections of politics, daily life, propaganda, and visual culture in China after 1949. At ChinaComx, I am researching the politics of lianhuanhua in their national and international dimension. I do so by approaching lianhuanhua as comics, that is, a hot and affective medium that found use in political communication efforts and enjoyed a mass readership alike. I explore their close relation to comics and their functioning as political manuals, but also the ways enemies of the state and other villains were depicted in the panels of lianhuanhua. I am also responsible for the graphic and web design of  the project. 

Previous to joining Heidelberg University, I worked in two research projects at the University of Freiburg: in 2018-2019 at [“The Maoist Legacy”](https://www.maoistlegacy.de/) and in 2019-2023 at [“READCHINA”](https://readchina.github.io). Since 2021, I am also a collaborator in the project [“Revisiting the Revolution: Engaging Chinese Scholarship through Collaborative Translation”](http://prchistory.org/revisiting-the-revolution-landing-page/). My first book project tackles the phenomenon of political study and other collective reading practices in the PRC after 1949.
