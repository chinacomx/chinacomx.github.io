 My research focuses on lianhuanhua as a genre, exploring the messages and ideologies conveyed through these works using computational approaches. Employing visual language models and computational literary techniques, I analyze the depiction and evolution of specific characters, with particular attention to the hero archetype in lianhuanhua. Through a large-scale examination of lianhuanhua published after 1949, I investigate how heroes and related characters are shaped, identifying their defining traits and actions, and tracking how these representations evolved over time. My work seeks to uncover the underlying processes of collective construction that inform these portrayals. I also study the themes and narrative structures in lianhuanhua, identifying recurring patterns across varied stories to better understand how key messages and concepts are expressed and reshaped over time.
