My dissertation explores the engagement of ordinary citizens with lianhuanhua and the formation of its fan culture in Shanghai after the 1940s. I aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how ordinary Chinese citizens collectively remember lianhuanhua and how fandom evolved within the broader context of national construction. Specifically, I focus on temporary bookstalls, Xinhua Bookstores, and private collections, which offer promising insights into reading habits and activities. This study utilizes a wide range of archival materials, field observations, and interviews to illustrate the relationships between the production, dissemination, and consumption of lianhuanhua on the street. My research interests also include various aspects of fan culture, Japanese comics, and exhibitions.
