<p>Article abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This article examines how, in the years following the end of the Cultural Revolution (1966 – 76), Jiang Qing 江青 (1914 – 91) became a negative icon of a liberated woman in high office in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). During the Cultural Revolution, Jiang Qing transformed herself into a model female political leader. After her arrest in 1976, however, political caricatures systematically deconstructed her curated image by transforming her into the antithesis of the ideal powerful woman in a socialist society. Since a model liberated female politician was not yet available, Jiang Qing served as an “iconic anti-icon” of women in politics under state socialism. Acknowledging the importance of Jiang Qing as a historical figure in Maoist China, this article analyzes how post – Cultural Revolution caricatures of her provide us with an understanding of the Chinese Communist Party’s anxieties about women in power, and it raises questions about the absence of an iconic woman-leader in the PRC’s political visual culture despite years of campaigning to achieve women’s liberation.</p>

<p>Damian will also present on 12 July a joint paper titled “<strong>Beyond Manga and Marvel: Digitally Approaching Chinese Comics (Lianhuanhua)</strong>,” which provides overview of the DH scope of ChinaComx – paper abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For many years now digital humanities (DH) scholars have approached graphic narratives such as comics as primary sources for digitally enhanced academic engagements with culture, history, or society. However, extant literature mainly focuses on US-American comic books, Japanese manga, or French/Belgian bandes dessinées. Lianhuanhua, a type of Chinese comics mostly consisting of a single image panel with a few lines of text below, are by and large overlooked—and this despite their untapped potential as novel sources for DH scholarship. Through the ERC-funded research project “Comics Culture in the People’s Republic of China (ChinaComx)” we aim to expand the related fields by introducing lianhuanhua as a new source employing digital tools, programming, and computer vision. While contemporary Chinese webcomics can be downloaded and read on mobile devices, earlier lianhuanhua were produced on low quality paper and in small pocket-size format resulting in a distinct instability of the books. Their materiality is a key characteristic of this medium, defining it both as a distinct type of graphic narrative while also pointing toward shared elements with other comics of different origins. Making use of the digitized CATS-Seifert Collection of Chinese Comics at Heidelberg University consisting of over 3000 unique lianhuanhua, ChinaComx makes extensive use of digitizing the physical records, advanced OCR-ing, and AI-assisted automatized translation of large datasets consisting of the image-text dyads. Furthermore, we also plan to do DH aided visual analyses, using methods such as visual language processing or network analysis, to delve into issues such scene composition, stylometry or genre defining visual features of lianhuanhua. The results of these, collected and made available to the public via an OA digital database, will not only allow non-Chinese speakers to read and engage with lianhuanhua, but they will also present engaging case studies to be picked up and expanded by other DH scholars. ChinaComx will thus also digitally preserve lianhuanhua and make them available for university and school classroom use. In this proposed presentation, we will give an overview of the ChinaComx sources, DH approaches and potential issues related to ethics and longevity of digital scholarship on Chinese comics.</p>

<p>His paper abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Conventional understanding of post-Cultural Revolution China suggests a gradual but steady shift from politics to production. However, did politics truly vanish, or did one form of the political replace another? This paper takes a case study approach, examining a selection of mid-1970s mass-reading campaigns, to inquire how political study continued to shape the daily lives of workers and cadres. The mass phase of the Cultural Revolution, due to the excesses of group readings of confessions and accusations at struggle sessions, rendered texts relevant to virtually everyone. Once it was over by the early-1970s, it gave way again to more systematically organized practices of collective reading akin to those functioning in the PRC since 1949. While study materials swiftly adapted to current political goals, a system of incentives and penalties ensured regular participation. Detailed descriptions from above further facilitated a tightly controlled guidance. State propaganda hence put much effort in utilizing collective reading practices to convey notions of statehood, class struggle, and mass society. At the same time, collective readers ultimately choose their own participation strategies ranging from enthusiastic activism through careful ignorance to blatant disruption. Examining the intertwined relationship between collective reading practices, the resurgence of the state apparatus, and the intra-party struggles over Mao’s succession illustrates how the lived experience of politics retained its significance also within the context of state socialist promotion of production.</p>

<p>Her paper abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is a truism that Chinese culture is a culture of reading; and – with the exception of the time of high socialism – reading has always been a marker of cultural capital. Yet, how exactly did reading impact on individuals, society and the larger developments and transformations in Chinese history? What did Chinese citizens read when, why, and how? In how far was reading a transformative act for everyone – and what readings were limited to certain groups, to intellectual, literary or political elites? Studying historical reading practices poses a number of methodological problems, not least because it is very often a private, even intimate activity of which little historical documents exist. Extant accounts – often autobiographical sources – are ephemeral, anecdotal, and very often vague. To analyze reading practices during China’s long 1970s quantitatively, we developed the ReadAct database (https://readchina.github.io/readact.html) chronicling concrete historical reading acts as recorded in a broad array of life writing sources. In this paper, I will present findings from the database, taking into account the biases and blind spots in the sources and in the database. Considering that most accounts were written by urban educated youth sent to the countryside and considering what they chose to write about in their accounts (and what to leave out) the database chronicles how much of the social, literary and intellectual change commonly associated with the early years of the reform era had its origins in the reading quests of the rusticated educated youth. Moreover, these reading quests also anticipate how as a group these youths – many of them social and political outcasts at the time – would transform into the literary, cultural and / or intellectual elite of the early reform years.</p>
