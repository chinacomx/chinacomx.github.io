<p>The conference, arising from a growing reception of the sonic turn also in Chinese and Asian Studies, explores how sound, voice, noise, radio, and other auditory media and modes can contribute to a field of Sound Studies that remains dominated by theories drawn from Western experience.</p>

<p>Damian will be presenting a chapter draft from his current book project on political study and other collective reading practices in the PRC. The paper, titled “Radio Study and the Sounds of Collective Reading Practices in the People’s Republic of China”, focuses, in the first part, on the phenomenon of radio study (<em>guangbo xuexi</em>) of the 1950s-1980s, and, in the second part, on various diegetic and nondiegetic sounds of collective reading activites.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Collective reading practices were a defining feature in Chinese state-socialist propaganda efforts after 1949. Occurring via obligatory political study classes for workers, cadres, soldiers, and others, these social rituals involved session leaders conducting and collective readers engaging in guided group study and text discussion. But, to take part in any such collective reading session was inevitably linked to the act of (collective) listening. Leaders often read selected fragments aloud and offered insights through brief lectures, expecting the collective readers to listen attentively to their voice and presented contents. At times, the collective readers heard without listening: the communicated contents passed through the minds of the listeners without retention. Radio broadcasts and other auditory media were also used, especially in rural areas, extending political education and disseminating information and
linking the auditory experience of politics with daily life. But these could break or malfunction, distorting the broadcast beyond comprehension. As recent scholarship has deepened our understanding of sound’s political uses (Lei 2019; Li 2020; Tang 2020; Santacaterina 2021; Wang 2022; Lekner 2022, 2024), this paper asks: In what ways did sound and voice work toward (or against) the goals pursued by organized forms of political study in the People’s Republic of China? In what ways did listening to Marx being read aloud differ from silent study of Marx? How did the voice, timbre, and enunciation of reading group leaders impact listeners’ reception of Lenin? How, then, did the party-state prepare for and evaluate the auditory elements of collective reading? This paper presents a comprehensive study of radio study (guangbo xuexi 广播学习) and similar sound-based study methods, utilizing archival broadcasts, radio magazines, state archives, and memoirs. In examining the auditory ways of collective reading practices, it explores the uses and failures of political communication under state socialism.</p>

<p>Workshop abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What does it mean to position a distinct medium as the defining element of inquiry? How does this change when the medium is also recognized as a specific (literary) genre? And how do approaches to studying history, art, culture, politics, and society shift when said medium / genre takes center stage in research? The medium in question is lianhuanhua, a distinct Chinese form of comics, and with this workshop, hosted by the ERC-ChinaComx project at Heidelberg University, we welcome interdisciplinary contributions examining lianhuanhua from diverse perspectives: whether as a distinct historical phenomenon, a part of global visual narratives, or a case study illuminating broader cultural or political contexts. How do we define lianhuanhua and how do our definitions change across different times and contexts? And what are the implications—direct and indirect—of approaching lianhuanhua as a research method? A central premise is that lianhuanhua serves as lens for (critical) inquiry: placing lianhuanhua at the forefront of analysis thus aims to expand all our various research approaches and fields. By starting with the image-text and then extending the analysis to other texts, events, and media in the larger context of production, dissemination, and consumption of lianhuanhua, the workshop seeks to offer a site for discussing how we understand the intersections of political communication, visual narratives, and meaning production.</p>

Xiao</a> will present her research during the 2025 <a href="https://www.diggitmagazine.com/events/child-and-book-conference-2025">Child and the Book Conference</a>. This year’s edition is running under the theme “Children Shaping The(ir) World: Between the Exceptional and the Everyday” and will be hosted on 23-25 April 2025 at <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/current/events/child-book-2025">Tilburg University</a>, Netherlands.</p>

<p>Astrid will present her paper in Session 2 (14:00–15:45) as part of Panel 4: Political Childhoods, chaired by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna-Czernow">Anna Czernow</a>. Titled “Inventing A Non-typical Young Role Model in Communist China: Everyday Heroism in Comics about Lei Feng (1960s–2020s)”, her talk explores how children’s comics and picturebooks in China has shaped political and moral ideals across generations, through the evolving portrayal of the national icon Lei Feng.</p>

<p>Astrid’s paper abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Considering the powerful influence of role models on youth, crafting and promoting role models is (and was) a common strategy for nation-building and educating younger generations in China. These role models are often titled “(Little) Heroes”, with their faces and stories being frequently featured in textbooks, school wall newspapers, and on children’s bookshelves. In 1960s communist China, these celebrated heroes primarily displayed traits of loyalty to Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, patriotism, and a strong passion for revolution and socialist construction. While heroism is a broad concept that also includes acts of kindness and courage in everyday life—acknowledged today as the “banality of heroism” (Franco and Zimbardo, 2006)—in the 1960s, China predominantly favored the celebration of exceptional heroes in its political and educational narratives. This paper focuses on an exception of the exceptional. Lei Feng, a real-life People’s Liberation Army soldier who died aged 22 in 1962, was known as a moral exemplar for his pure altruism and numerous good deeds. Since the 1960s, Lei Feng’s stories from his childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood have been crafted into various forms of propagandist materials (story collections, posters, comics, etc.) and have been widely received by Chinese children from different generations. By close reading 14 comics and picturebooks about Lei Feng produced between the 1960s and 2020s, I argue that, from the very beginning, these visual texts oscillated between the grand narratives of national construction and a mundane hero who does every small everyday deed well. This oscillation tries to break free from the inappropriateness of conventional exceptional hero narratives in Lei Feng’s case. Ultimately, over more than half a century of oscillation, everyday heroism has clearly triumphed. Whether in terms of characterization or artistic style, 21st-century comics depict Lei Feng as more commonplace and accessible, bringing him closer to his young friends and followers both in the comics and in real life. The victory of everyday heroism in the comics about Lei Feng can not only be seen as a shift in the styles of political propaganda in modern China, but it also demonstrates that, over the past decades, child readers have been rediscovered and reevaluated.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The practice of copying, broadly defined, has drawn scholarly interests from an array of disciplines in the China field as China emerges as a powerful economy while at the same time achieving notoriety as the “quintessential copycat.” Instead of holding onto its conventional definition, mostly informed by the contemporary IPR regime, recent scholars have problematized the notion of copying itself by historicizing its varying practices in different fields. STS scholars recast copying (or tinkering or prototyping) as a serious technological endeavor with emphasis on its experimental nature; art historians redefine imitation as transformative artistic work; and literary scholars approach hand-copying as a way of rewriting where the boundary between authors and readers remains fluid. Some historians, on the other hand, challenge the assumption about the lenient attitude toward copying in Chinese culture while others question the entrenched link between China and copying by demonstrating that it was not a uniquely Chinese practice. All these studies call for a more nuanced approach to the history of copying in China and beyond with attention to its temporal changes in different social and cultural contexts. This roundtable session presents discussants who have addressed these issues in their respective fields, providing an interdisciplinary forum to discuss this highly contested (and often politically charged) subject.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lu Xun is seen as the founding father of modern Chinese literature; thanks to the propagandistic efforts of the Chinese Communist Party, he was posthumously framed as a revolutionary fighter wielding his pen for the sake of the nation, and the revolution. This (re-)framing rested on political speeches appropriating the famous intellectual, on depictions of the author on propaganda posters, as well as on adaptations of his person and his works into Chinese comics (lianhuanhua连环画). In my presentation, I will sketch this process and argue that comics, as a medium combining text and image, were particularly well suited to this end, quite literally framing Lu Xun and his works from different viewpoints. As adaptations, lianhuanhua represent distinct readings of famous literary works – and as a genre of “pulp fiction”, they reached massive audiences, thus impacting how large parts of the Chinese population would read Lu Xun. I will show how lianhuanhua had their part in the styling of Lu Xun into a devoted revolutionary. Yet, time and again, lianhuanhua moved beyond the narrow reading of the CCP’s Luxunology, thus demonstrating that as a genre it is particularly well-suited to move beyond the narrow frames of official ideology, and that the texts of Lu Xun themselves defy easy readings and appropriations through Party ideology. Core to this are the ambivalences inscribed into the texts of Lu Xun, as well as the depictions of his eyebrows and moustache.</p>

<p>Their talk is titled <strong>Beyond Captain America and Akira: Heroes and Villains in Chinese Comics and Caricature</strong>,  abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comics are a global medium with local variations and characteristics, emanating from different historical, cultural, social, political, and economic contexts. Putting the many differences aside, many forms of comics often share high popularity, expressive visuals and a focus on positive and negative role models. In this presentation, we therefore propose to look at Chinese comics (lianhuanhua) and caricature (manhua) through the lens of heroes and villains to offer both a general overview of these visual media and a specific examination of one of its core tropes. We will show how the era of high Maoism of the 1960s-1970s was also a heyday of the lianhuanhua genre as it was widely used as a tool for education and propaganda. Contrary to popular belief, also throughout the early Reform Era of the 1980s, lianhuanhua continued to shape prototypes of ideological heroes and villains, rendering all kinds of role models easy to detect. At the same time, however, Chinese comics began to critically re-examine the Maoist years, adapted (officially and bootleg) Hollywood blockbusters, and to, employ a fuller repertoire of expressive and ambivalent visual techniques, including pencil drawing, oil painting, traditional Chinese papercut and watercolors, or woodcut inspired by European modernism, thus undermining the previously clear-cut notions of what makes a hero (or villain) and they would have to look like. And although lianhuanhua as a particular medium-specific type of Chinese comics mostly faded away toward the end of the century, these handy pocket-sized booklets were shared among children and adults alike to be read at street stall libraries or at work units after hours for over seven decades. With an estimated 50.000 unique titles published since 1949 and one-in-three new books published in 1986 being a lianhuanhua, Chinese comics deserve broader recognition and scholarly interest both as distinct genre and area of academic research.</p>

<p>Article abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This article examines how, in the years following the end of the Cultural Revolution (1966 – 76), Jiang Qing 江青 (1914 – 91) became a negative icon of a liberated woman in high office in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). During the Cultural Revolution, Jiang Qing transformed herself into a model female political leader. After her arrest in 1976, however, political caricatures systematically deconstructed her curated image by transforming her into the antithesis of the ideal powerful woman in a socialist society. Since a model liberated female politician was not yet available, Jiang Qing served as an “iconic anti-icon” of women in politics under state socialism. Acknowledging the importance of Jiang Qing as a historical figure in Maoist China, this article analyzes how post – Cultural Revolution caricatures of her provide us with an understanding of the Chinese Communist Party’s anxieties about women in power, and it raises questions about the absence of an iconic woman-leader in the PRC’s political visual culture despite years of campaigning to achieve women’s liberation.</p>

<p>Damian will also present on 12 July a joint paper titled “<strong>Beyond Manga and Marvel: Digitally Approaching Chinese Comics (Lianhuanhua)</strong>,” which provides overview of the DH scope of ChinaComx – paper abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For many years now digital humanities (DH) scholars have approached graphic narratives such as comics as primary sources for digitally enhanced academic engagements with culture, history, or society. However, extant literature mainly focuses on US-American comic books, Japanese manga, or French/Belgian bandes dessinées. Lianhuanhua, a type of Chinese comics mostly consisting of a single image panel with a few lines of text below, are by and large overlooked—and this despite their untapped potential as novel sources for DH scholarship. Through the ERC-funded research project “Comics Culture in the People’s Republic of China (ChinaComx)” we aim to expand the related fields by introducing lianhuanhua as a new source employing digital tools, programming, and computer vision. While contemporary Chinese webcomics can be downloaded and read on mobile devices, earlier lianhuanhua were produced on low quality paper and in small pocket-size format resulting in a distinct instability of the books. Their materiality is a key characteristic of this medium, defining it both as a distinct type of graphic narrative while also pointing toward shared elements with other comics of different origins. Making use of the digitized CATS-Seifert Collection of Chinese Comics at Heidelberg University consisting of over 3000 unique lianhuanhua, ChinaComx makes extensive use of digitizing the physical records, advanced OCR-ing, and AI-assisted automatized translation of large datasets consisting of the image-text dyads. Furthermore, we also plan to do DH aided visual analyses, using methods such as visual language processing or network analysis, to delve into issues such scene composition, stylometry or genre defining visual features of lianhuanhua. The results of these, collected and made available to the public via an OA digital database, will not only allow non-Chinese speakers to read and engage with lianhuanhua, but they will also present engaging case studies to be picked up and expanded by other DH scholars. ChinaComx will thus also digitally preserve lianhuanhua and make them available for university and school classroom use. In this proposed presentation, we will give an overview of the ChinaComx sources, DH approaches and potential issues related to ethics and longevity of digital scholarship on Chinese comics.</p>
