  <article>
    <p>The Institute for Chinese Studies at Heidelberg University (Center for Asian and Transcultural Studies) invites applications for <strong>three PhD positions</strong> within the framework of the ERC funded research project <strong>“Comics Culture in the People’s Republic of China (ChinaComx)”</strong> to start in September 2024.</p>

<p><strong>ChinaComx</strong> investigates the intellectual, political, social, historical, and transcultural dimensions of a medium still heavily understudied: lianhuanhua, literally “linked images” 连环画. It studies them as a medium from the People’s Republic of China and its place within the larger Chinese and global comics culture. Studying the conditions of comic art’s production, distribution and consumption, the project sheds light on how comics contribute to the project of nation building, to the creation of a new socialist human and to the continued legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In addition, it investigates how these at times highly propagandistic texts were read by ordinary citizens—and how, at the same time, lianhuanhua were one of the most popular reading materials presenting stories loved by children and adults alike. In providing more knowledge about comic culture from China and in contributing to theoretical debates, ChinaComx aims to delineate the term „lianhuanhua“ as a distinct genre and area of academic research that bears specific characteristics, being embedded in a particular context of origin, yet, changing across time and space as Japanese <em>manga</em>, Korean <em>manhwa</em> or Franco-Belgian <em>bandes desinnées</em>.</p>

<h3 id="your-tasks">Your tasks:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Conceptualization and execution of a doctoral project within one of the three focus areas delineated below</li>
  <li>Active participation in the joint activities of the project (including seminars and workshops, joint writing projects and translations; (digital) exhibitions)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-three-focus-areas">The three focus areas:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Aesthetics and Theories of Lianhuanhua in China</em>: This subproject will study visual characteristics and their changes over time and bring these into dialogue with the respective contemporary theoretical debates in China and abroad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Comics and Fandom Culture</em>: This subproject is situated at the intersection of comics, online fiction and fan culture. Potential points of research could be the various forms of contemporary fan culture, including nostalgic lianhuanhua readers as well as those of webcomics, but also earlier “fans” of the medium.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Computational Research into Comics</em>: This subproject will use advanced digital humanities methods, such as visual language processing or network analysis, to delve into issues such scene composition, stylometry or genre defining visual features of lianhuanhua, working on a big data corpus or a chosen singular comic.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="your-profile">Your profile:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Above average Master degree (in subjects such as Chinese Studies, Literary, Cultural or Media Studies, History, Social Sciences, History of Art, Musicology, Film Studies, Computer Linguistics or Digital Humanities)</li>

  <li>In-depth knowledge of Chinese culture and society, past and present</li>
  <li>Interest in visual cultures and in digital humanities</li>
  <li>Experiences in programming or coding are welcome, but not essential</li>
  <li>German language skills are welcome, but not essential</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="we-offer">We offer:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The possibility to write a dissertation as part of an interdisciplinary team with ample opportunities for academic exchange within the team and within the larger academic community in Heidelberg</li>
  <li>A three-year fixed-term contract at Heidelberg University, with a potential half-year extension</li>
  <li>Salary based on the collective bargaining agreement of the German federal states (TV-L E13, 60%)</li>
  <li>Integration into an interdisciplinary team</li>
  <li>Supervision of your writing and coaching for writing academic papers</li>
  <li>A stimulating research environment boasting a vibrant academic community, one of Europe’s finest collections in Chinese Studies, including, in particular, a collection of more than 3000 lianhuanhua</li>
  <li>An office located on the grounds of the Center of Asian and Transcultural Studies at Heidelberg University</li>
  <li>Participation in international conferences and opportunities for publication of your research results, as well as in additional research activities such as international translation projets and more</li>
